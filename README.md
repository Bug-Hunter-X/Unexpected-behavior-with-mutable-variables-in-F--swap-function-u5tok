This example demonstrates a common issue in F# related to mutable variables and the unexpected behavior that can arise when not carefully managing their scope within functions. The `swap` function intends to exchange the values of `x` and `y`, but due to the way mutable variables are handled, it doesn't work as intended. This demonstrates the importance of understanding variable scope when using mutable variables in F#.
